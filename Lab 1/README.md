**Lab design by Professor Chen-Wei(Jackie) Wang**

#### **The relevant entities involved in this problem:**
- Each update **log** is characterized by their version (e.g., 5.7.31) and fixes from the earlier version (e.g.,Addressed writing lag issues). A log's fixes are represented as a comma-separated list of string values enclosed within a pair of square brackets (e.g.,[Fix 1, Fix 2, Fix 3]). The maximum number of allowable fixes for an update log is 10.
